# NQueen-Almost-perfect-heuristic
implementation of article L.V Kale
in this code we implemented an algorithm got NQueen problem with atmost N = 1000 
algorithm is explained in [this article ](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Almost-Perfect-Heuristic-for-the-N-Nonattacking-Kal%C3%A9/8dc7dd62054b608bf16cf5e12be461f1b4accead)
